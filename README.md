RoketzClone

Beginner's guide to development:

1. Start Unity
2. Open RoketzClone _directory_
3. Open Scenes/SampleScene.scene
4. You can now press play to debug live
5. Behaviour code is in Scripts directory (open solution in VS/Rider/VSCode)

Tips:

Public fields in scripts are exposed in Unity. Click on "Player1" and you'll be able to edit "Top Speed", "Acceleration" and "Turn Rate" even while the game is running
